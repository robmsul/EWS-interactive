EWS 2018 Interactive is a storytelling project that follows the entire 2018 Enduro World Serious round by round.
The web app uses html5, css3, vanilla javascript, and jquery plugins for several elements. I completed the project
for Mejo 487, Intermediate Interactive Multimedia at the UNC - Chapel Hill School of Media and Journalism.
